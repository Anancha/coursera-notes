# Week 1
## Musical Notes
### Octave
- The interval between two notes with one having twice of half of the frequency of the other
### Semitone and tone
### Scale
- Tonic: letter name of the scale
- Quality: Order of tones and semitones in a scale
- Diatonic Scale: 7 notes with some pattern of 5 tones and 2 semitones
- Ionian Mode
	- C Major: C D E F G A B C
	- Quality: T T S T T T S (T = Tone, S = Semitone)
	- Major Scale
- Aeolian Mode
	- A B C D E F G A
	- Quality: T S T T S T T
	- Natural Minor Scale

	- Quality: S T T S T T T
	- B C D E F G A B
### Chords
- Triad - three notes
- Perfect fifth - 7 semitones from fifth
- Diminished fifth - 6 semitones from fifth
- Major third - 4 semitones from third
- Minor third - 3 semitones from third
- Major chord
	- perfect fifth + major third
	- Major triad if the chord has three notes
- Minor chord
	- perfect fifth + minor third
	- Minor triad if the chord has three notes
- Diminished triad - diminished fifth + minor third
- In A minor scale
	- A B C D E
		- T S T T
		- 7 semitones
		- A to C
			- 3 semitones
		- Amin: A C E
- In C major scale
	- C D E F G
		- T T S T
		- 7 semitones
		- C D E
			- 4 semitones
		- Cmaj: C E G
			- perfect fifth + major third = major triad
### Primary
- C major: tonic triad
- G major: dominant
- F major: subdominant
- In hamonizing music, it is common to have the melodic note a member of a chord that is backing it

# Week2
## Sharps & Flats
#### Motivation: TTSTTTS - major scale
- Starting from G, we need to bring F a semitone higher to be F# to fit the major scale

#### Sharp
- one semitone higher
#### Flat
- one semitone lower
#### We need one note per letter in a scale

## Keys and Key Signatures
#### If we use notes from C major scale for music, we say it is in the key of C major
#### Key
- related to the feelings
#### Key Signatures
- tell which notes should be sharp, which notes should be flat
- C Major: no sharp and no flat
- G Major: F#
- D Major: F#, C#
- Circle of fifth
  - Clockwise, the next major is the fifth to the current one
  - Counter clockwise, the next major is the fourth to the current one
- Accidental: use a note that is not supposed to be in the major
  - Put # and b to the note to indicate a sharp or flat; affects the whole bar
  - Use the natural symbol to cancel the previous instruction on using # or b for the whole bar

#### Minor Keys
- 6th degree is what minor scale is built from
- Natural Minor
  - Take notes from the major and start from the relative minor
- Harmonic Minor
  - Raised a semi tone on 7th
  - 7th called leading note 
- Melodic Minor
  - Ascending: Keep raised 7th, also raise 6th a semi tone
  - Descending: natural minor

#### Intervals
- Perfect Unison: two exact same notes
- Major 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th
- Perfect 4th, 5th, 8/ve
   - Intervals are same for all major and minor keys
- Minor intervals
   - Count to figure out it is 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc
   - Image the lower note is the major key, if the other note is one semi tone lower than the nth note in that major scale, it is a minor interval
- Augment intervals
   - 1 semitone up from perfect interval
- Diminished intervals
   - 1 semitone down from perfect interval
- From major interval
   - 1 semitone up is augmented interval
   - 1 semitone down is minor interval
   - 2 semitone down is diminished interval

#### Ledger Lines and Clefs
- Treble Clef
- Bass Clef
   - One ledger line above is middle C
- Alto Clef
- Tenor Clef
