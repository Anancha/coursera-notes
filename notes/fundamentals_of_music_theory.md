# Week 1
## Musical Notes
### Octave
- The interval between two notes with one having twice of half of the frequency of the other

### Semitone and tone
### Scale
- Tonic: letter name of the scale
- Quality: Order of tones and semitones in a scale
- Diatonic Scale: 7 notes with some pattern of 5 tones and 2 semitones
- Ionian Mode
  - C Major: C D E F G A B C
  - Quality: T T S T T T S (T = Tone, S = Semitone)
  - Major Scale
- Aeolian Mode
  - A B C D E F G A
  - Quality: T S T T S T T
  - Natural Minor Scale
- Dorian Mode
  - Quality: T S T T T S T
  - D E F G A B C D

  - Quality: T T S T T S T
  - G A B C D E F G
- Locrian Mode
  - Quality: S T T S T T T
  - B C D E F G A B

### Chords
- Triad - three notes
- Perfect fifth - 7 semitones from fifth
- Diminished fifth - 6 semitones from fifth
- Major third - 4 semitones from third
- Minor third - 3 semitones from third
- Major chord
  - perfect fifth + major third
  - Major triad if the chord has three notes
- Minor chord
  - perfect fifth + minor third
  - Minor triad if the chord has three notes
- Diminished triad - diminished fifth + minor third
- In A minor scale
  - A B C D E
    - T S T T
    - 7 semitones
    - A to C
      - 3 semitones
    - Amin: A C E
- In C major scale
  - C D E F G
    - T T S T
    - 7 semitones
    - C D E
      - 4 semitones
    - Cmaj: C E G
      - perfect fifth + major third = major triad

### Primary
- Tonic triad
  - Built on first scale degree of a diatonic scale
- Subdominant triad
  - Built on the fourth note
  - In the case of C major, subdominant will be F major
- Dominant tria
  - Built on the fifth note
  - In the case of C major, dominant will be G major
- In hamonizing music, it is common to have the melodic note a member of a chord that is backing it

# Week2
## Sharps & Flats
#### Motivation: TTSTTTS - major scale
- Starting from G, we need to bring F a semitone higher to be F# to fit the major scale

#### Sharp
- one semitone higher

#### Flat
- one semitone lower

#### We need one note per letter in a scale

## Keys and Key Signatures
#### If we use notes from C major scale for music, we say it is in the key of C major
#### Key
- related to the feelings

#### Key Signatures
- Tell which notes should be sharp, which notes should be flat by their positions
  - C Major: no sharp and no flat
  - G Major: F#
  - D Major: F#, C#
- [Circle of fifth](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yf8sy6qcft8hjr0/Circle%20of%205ths.png)
  - Clockwise, the next major is the fifth to the current one
  - Counter clockwise, the next major is the fourth to the current one
  - When sharps appear in a key signature, they always appear in the order of F C G D A E B (clockwise around the circle)
  - When flats appear in a key signature, they always appear in the order of B E A D G C F (counter clockwise)
  - When you see a key signature with *x* sharps, go *x* steps from C closewise and get the key
  - When you see a key signature with *x* flats, go *x* steps from C counter clockwise and get the key
- Accidental: use a note that is not supposed to be in the major
  - Put # and b to the note to indicate a sharp or flat; affects the whole bar
  - Use the natural symbol to cancel the previous instruction on using # or b for the whole bar

#### Minor Keys
- Relative minor
  - 6th degree is what minor scale is built from
  - The key has the same key signature as the note it is built from and has the same notes. But orienting on a different key changes the internal relationship
- Natural Minor (Aeolian Mode)
  - Take notes from the major and start from the relative minor
- Harmonic Minor
  - Raised a semi tone on 7th
  - 7th called leading note 
- Melodic Minor
  - Ascending: Keep raised 7th, also raise 6th a semi tone
  - Descending: natural minor
- Relative major
  - A minor third above the tonic of the minor
- **Relative keys share the same key signature**

#### Intervals
- Perfect Unison: two exact same notes
- Distance between first and 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th is Major 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th
- Distance between first and 4th, 5th and 8/ve is Perfect 4th, 5th, 8/ve
   - Intervals are same for all major and minor keys
- Minor intervals
   - Count to figure out it is 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc
   - Image the lower note is the major key, if the other note is one semi tone lower than the nth note in that major scale, it is a minor interval
- Augment intervals
   - 1 semitone up from perfect interval
- Diminished intervals
   - 1 semitone down from perfect interval
- From major interval
   - 1 semitone up is augmented interval
   - 1 semitone down is minor interval
   - 2 semitone down is diminished interval

#### Ledger Lines and Clefs
- Treble Clef
- Bass Clef
   - One ledger line above is middle C
- Alto Clef
- Tenor Clef

# Week 3
### Rythmic Duration
- Whole Note (Semibreve)
- Half Note (Minim)
- Quarter Note (Crotchet)
- Eighth Note (Quaver)
- Sixteenth Note (Semiquaver)

### Tuplets
- The number indicates a ratio to the next lower normal value
  - A quintuplet indicated with the numeral 5 means that five of the indicated note value total the duration normally occupied by 4
  - Sometimes we write explicitly the ratio like 4:3, 7:11, etc.

### Ties & Dots
- Tie
  - Extend a duration of a note
  - Notes tied together are not played separately
- Dot
  - Extend the duration of the original note by half
  - Can half multiple dots attached to a single note, each extending the duration of the original note by 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, etc
- Pause
  - Out of the time duration determined by the musician
  - Commonly it is twice the duration of the note

### Meter
- Numerator means how many beats per bar, denominator means the type of base note
  - 4/4 means 4 quarter notes per bar
  - 3/8 means 3 eighth notes per bar
- Simple meter uses notes of 2, 4, 8, etc
- Compound meter uses dotted notes so it is easy to subdivide them to 3
  - 6/8 is 2 dotted quarter notes

### Anacrusis, Phrases and Structure
- Anacrusis
  - Start each of the phrases with a pick up note
- Phrases
  - A group of several bars that feels melodically complete
- Motif
  - Isolated short music signals easily recognized
  - Always repeated

### Form
- Binary form
  - Two sections: A B
  - B colsely related to A but gernerally in different key
  - Repeatedly
- Ternary form
  - A B A
  - Return of A is usually modified: A B A'
- Rondo form
- 12 Bar Blues
