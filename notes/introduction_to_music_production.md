# Introduction to Music Production

## Week 1

### Properties of Sound
- Propagation: Sounds moving through a medium
- Amplitude: The extent of air compression
	- measured by decibels
	- different from loudness: amplitude can be measured; loudness is human perception of amplitude
- Frequency: How fast the sound is vibrating
	- Timbre: collection of frequencies
- All properties are independent

### Visulizing Sound
- Oscilloscopr: Amplitude over time; no frequency info
- Spectrum Analyzer: Ampliture versus Frequency
	- One octove higher, double the frequency, no amplitude changed
	- Harmonics have multiples of fundamental frequency
- Sonogram: Combines the above

### Studio Workflow
- Microphone: air pressure to voltage as audio signal
	- Condesener Microphone: sensitive
	- Dynamic Microphone: tries to only pick up the speaker
	- Frequency Response: how microphones selectively pick up different sounds
	- Polar Pattern: Areas of microphones to pick up well
- Line Level: a level all devices operate on
	- +4: studio level
	- -10: consumer level
- Gain Stage: amplify or attenuate the level of signal
	- Ideally brings the sound up once to the line level
- Cable
	- 1/4 (TS/Instrument) cable
	- TRS (stereo) cable
	- XLR cable: reject noise
	- Direct box: TS to XLR/TRS
	- 1/8 cable: for headphone
- Audio Interface: bring signal up to line level, analog to digital conversion
