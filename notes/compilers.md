Compilers
Week One
- Two implementations for programs
  - Interpreters (online): Takes data and program and gives the output
  - Compilers (offline): Takes program and produces an executable, which given data will produces the output
- Fortan I is the first compiler. Modern compilers perserve its outline
  - Lexical analysis
  - Parsing
  - Semantica analysis
  - Optimization
  - Code generation
- Lexical analysis
  - Divide program texts into words or tokens
- Parsing
  - To a diagramming structure (tree)
- Semantica analysis
  - Compilers check for inconsistency
  - Languages have strict rules to avoid ambiguities
- Optimization
  - Run faster
  - Less memory
- Code generation
  - Translate high level language to assembly code (usually)
